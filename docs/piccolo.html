        He's usually just called Piccolo or Kamiccolo, is a Namekian and also
        the final child and reincarnation of King Piccolo, later becoming the
        reunification of the Nameless Namekian after fusing with Kami. According
        to Grand Elder Guru, Piccolo, along with Kami and King Piccolo, are part
        of the Dragon Clan, who were the original creators of the Dragon Balls.

        A wise and cunning warrior, he was the main antagonist in the final saga
        of Dragon Ball, the Piccolo Jr. Saga, and was thus a ruthless enemy of
        Goku. However, starting with the first saga of Dragon Ball Z, the Raditz
        Saga, he began to lose all villainous traits, and when he started
        training <a class="text-blue" href="./goku.html">Goku</a>'s son
        <a href="./gohan.html" class="text-blue">Gohan</a> during the Vegeta
        Saga which led to the two developing a strong bond with each other, he
        became a permanent member of the Dragon Team and eventually one of
        Earth's greatest heroes.

            The move is performed by touching the index and middle fingers of
            one hand to the forehead and charging enough ki to attack. Its speed
            changes to the power level of the user performing the move. When
            ready, the fingers are extended forward, and two thin energy beams
            are unleashed from the fingers. One remains straight while the other
            coils around the straight beam. The resulting beam is quite
            powerful, drilling through most targets, and exploding on the ones
            it can't. It can also be used with only one arm.

            When Piccolo asks Shenron to unlock his latent potential, the Dragon
            gives Piccolo a "little extra". Piccolo taps into this form for the
            first time during his battle with Gamma 2. It is said that this form
            gives Piccolo power that rivals even that of Goku.
