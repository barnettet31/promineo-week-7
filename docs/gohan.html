      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Gohan is a half-breed Saiyan and one of the most prominent characters in
        the Dragon Ball series. He is the elder son of the series' primary
        protagonist <a href="./goku.html" class="text-blue">Goku</a> and his wife Chi-Chi, the older brother of Goten, the
        husband of Videl and father to Pan.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        He is named after Goku's adoptive grandfather, Gohan. Unlike his father,
        Gohan lacks a passion for fighting (although, he does possess a strong
        power within him) and prefers to do so only when his loved ones are
        threatened. Nevertheless, Gohan fights alongside the Dragon Team in
        the defense of Earth for much of his life

        <td class="px-4 py-4">While in this form, Gohan's muscle mass increases slightly and hair stands straight up and spikier with the exception of one lock that hangs down. Also, his aura is surrounded by repeated flashes of blue electricity. Originally, so new with this massive boost of power, it warped Gohan's attitude, giving him an almost sadistic sense of mind as he wanted to make Cell suffer for his evil actions, whereas before Gohan was a pacifist to a fault who didn't want to hurt the villainous Cell. </td>
