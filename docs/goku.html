      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        born Kakarot, is a Saiyan raised on Earth and the overall main
        protagonist of the Dragon Ball series. Originally was sent to Earth as
        an infant, Kakarot would be adopted by Grandpa Gohan who named him Son
        Goku. A head injury at an early age alters Goku's memory, ridding him of
        his initial destructive nature and allowing him to grow up to become one
        of Earth's greatest defenders. He constantly strives and trains to be
        the greatest warrior possible, which has kept the Earth and the universe
        safe from destruction many times.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Goku was named Kakarot at birth by his father Bardock. In the manga,
        Kakarot was born on Planet Vegeta three years before its destruction,
        while in the anime he was born shortly before the destruction of the
        planet. When Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, Kakarot survived as he was
        being sent to Earth on a routine infiltration mission to destroy all
        life on the planet in order to sell it. After landing on Earth, the
        young Saiyan was found in the woods by an old man named
        <a href="./gohan.html" class="text-blue">Gohan</a> and became his
        adopted grandson. Grandpa Gohan names him "Son Goku".

            A technique taught to Goku by Grandpa Gohan which employs one of
            three attack styles; either a closed-fist assault, a two-finger
            jabbing assault, or an open-palm thrust assault. It was Goku's
            signature attack early on during his childhood, soon afterwards
            being replaced with the Kamehameha.

            Goku's strongest form in the original manga and anime. Goku achieved
            this level after years of training in Other World, where he could
            put unlimited energy into this form. In this form, his hair
            reaches down to his thighs and his eyebrows vanish completely while
            making the forehead and eye ridges larger and more prominent. His
            muscle mass grows noticeable larger more defined while his eyes gain
            green irises. His aura also becomes rounder with larger electrical
            sparks. Goku first used this form against Innocent Buu during the
            Majin Buu Saga, where he had a slight advantage over the Majin.
            However, this form is extremely draining in terms of energy due to
            the living world having less energy to siphon. This made him tire
            fast and even cut Goku's time left on Earth from hours to a mere
            thirty minutes after using this form for a short time. When
            attempting to gather enough energy to defeat Kid Buu, he was unable
            to sustain it as he had not taken into account the strain overcoming
            his living body, and soon reverted to his base state. Altogether,
            these heavy disadvantages make it impractical to use this form out
            of the afterlife and even more while alive
