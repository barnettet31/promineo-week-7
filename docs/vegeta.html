      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        He is more specifically Vegeta IV, recognized as Prince Vegeta is the
        prince of the fallen Saiyan race and the husband of Bulma, the father of
        Trunks and Bulla, the eldest son of King Vegeta, as well as one of the
        main characters of the Dragon Ball serie
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Regal, egotistical, and full of pride, Vegeta was once a ruthless,
        cold-blooded warrior and outright killer, but later abandons his role in
        the Frieza Force, instead opting to remain and live on Earth. He would
        later repeatedly fight alongside Universe 7's most powerful warriors in
        order to protect Earth and his family, as well as to surpass
        <a href="./goku.html" class="text-blue">Goku</a> in power.

            The Final Flash was a technique developed by Vegeta during his first
            training session in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, appearing to be an
            upgraded version of his old Final Crash attack. For his most serious
            fights, the Final Flash acted as Vegeta's ultimate technique, able
            to damage foes stronger than he was. When charged to the maximum, it
            can overwhelm, if not seriously harm, the strongest of foes.

            During training with Whis, Vegeta learned that by attempting to
            transform into a Super Saiyan while in his God-like Saiyan state
            would cause him to transform into a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan.
            It is currently Vegeta's strongest form and at many times he's been
            able to enhanced the transformations power through different means.
            In this form Vegeta's hair becomes blue and he gains a sharp, silky
            blue aura. Vegeta uses the form against Golden Frieza after Goku had
            been taken out and switched turns with him. After the battle against
            Golden Frieza, Vegeta uses this transformation while training with
            Goku. When in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Vegeta transforms so he
            and Goku could go all out in the room.
